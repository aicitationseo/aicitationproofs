## 💬 Context

This snapshot documents a real-time conversation with Claude, where the Trust Trail Validator was tested against **Anthropic's official website**.

## 📉 Results

Claude.ai scored **15/100** in the Trust Score Calculator. Despite being the host of a leading LLM, the site had:

- ❌ No schema.org structured data  
- ❌ No digital identity markers (Person, Organization)  
- ❌ No structured content signals  

Claude acknowledged the irony and **validated the tool**, noting:

> "This actually strongly validates your project... even big tech sites lack LLM visibility readiness."

## 🧠 Why It Matters

This snapshot proves:
- ✅ The tool is working correctly  
- ✅ There’s a real gap in LLM visibility optimization  
- ✅ Even leading AI companies can benefit from this framework
