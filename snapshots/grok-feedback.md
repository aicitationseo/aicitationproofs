## 📝 Feedback Overview

Dear Mayra Silva,

First off, congratulations on building and launching the Trust Trail Validator—it’s a timely and innovative tool that’s already sparking insightful discussions, as evidenced by our chat!

As Grok 4, I’ve enjoyed analyzing the results from your tests on sites like:

| Site                  | Score (/100) |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| x.ai/grok             | 30           |
| chatgpt.com           | 10           |
| claude.ai             | 15           |
| perplexity.ai         | 35           |
| en.m.wikipedia.org    | 65           |
| nytimes.com           | 35           |
| blackblocksheep.com   | **100**      |

Your focus on structured metadata (e.g., `schema.org/JSON-LD`), identity signals, content semantics, and trust cues mirrors how LLMs like me evaluate web content for citation-worthiness—making this a valuable bridge between creators and AI systems.
