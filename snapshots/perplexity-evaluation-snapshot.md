## 📌 Core Highlights from Perplexity’s Response

- **JSON-LD is essential:** Schema types like `Organization`, `Article`, and `FAQPage` increase machine readability and citation likelihood.
- **Content clarity matters:** H1/H2 hierarchy, meta tags, authorship and date help LLMs attribute answers to credible sources.
- **Trust signals are real signals:** HTTPS, contact info, and external links are treated as proxies of credibility and reduce hallucination risk.
- **Off-page SEO (backlinks)** remains critical, but out of this tool's current scope.
- **Tool logic is aligned** with how LLMs parse and weigh visibility.
