# 🖼️ Image Assets for Trust Trail Validator

This folder contains image snapshots used across the repository — including screenshots, validations, LLM outputs, and interface examples.

## Guidelines:
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g. `snapshot7_claude.png`)
- Reference images from Markdown using relative paths
- Keep all assets under 2MB when possible
- For new additions, create a corresponding `snapshot_X.md` or documentation file

💡 These visuals are part of the transparent proof system used for validating Trust Trails across LLMs.
